# Docker-and-R

I am using this repository to get some hands on Github and Docker.

## Github commands

- git branch <name branch>: create a new branch
- git checkout <branch name>: checkout the branch you want to use
- git branch -a: list all your branches
- git commit -m "message": commit
- git push: push
- git pull: pull
- git push --set-upstream <origin branch> <destination branch>: To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream
- git merge <with which branch we want to merge>: how to merge branches
- git reset --hard HEAD~1: to rollback a commit, it works when we marge as well. We can specify the number of commits by changing the **~#number**
- git branch -d <branch>: how to delete a branch
